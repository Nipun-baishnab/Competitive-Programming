This repository contains a comprehensive collection of topics I have explored throughout my competitive programming career. 
It includes templates that were frequently used and thoroughly tested. The content will be further refined to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. 

*** One important thing to notice is I use [ #define int long long ]  in almost everytime. You have to be careful about this. 

If you can't understand some portion of code / how to use a template / want to learn any topic feel free to ask me.
